## Using SRGANs to Generate Photo-Realistic Images

Keras implementation of "Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network"

Steps to set up the project:

1. `pip install scipy==1.1.0`

   Download 'img_align_celeba.zip' from "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7EVK8r0v71pTUZsaXdaSnZBZzg"

2. Train the SRGAN.ipynb as it is.
